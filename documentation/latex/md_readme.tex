\subsection*{Overview}

This is an smart A\+GV (Automated Guided Vehicle) project which can take commands from the end user, and navigate autonomously to perform a required task. This A\+GV is implemented in R\+OS Gazebo simulation environment using the Turtle\+Bot as the base platform. A custom global planner was written as a plugin, and uses the A$\ast$ algorithm for planning. S\+L\+AM was done prior on the environment to get a map for navigation.

\subsection*{Personnel}

This module was created by Shivang Patel as a final project for the University of Maryland course E\+N\+P\+M808X -\/ Software Development for Robotics during the Fall 2018 semester.
